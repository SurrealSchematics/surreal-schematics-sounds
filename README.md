# Soundscapes by Surreal Schematics

A collection of music composed by Brian Stephens, available for your use in FoundryVTT.

Currently there is only a single playlist, Skyros, designed to evoke feelings of Westeros and Skyrim, originally composed for the Skyrim mod of the same name.

Moving forward we expect to add additional playlists as they are released.
